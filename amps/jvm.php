		JVM410H
British-built, the 100 Watt all-valve JVM410H head redefines versatility thanks to four tonally independent channels: 
Clean, Crunch, OD1 and OD2, each with three switchable modes. Each mode reconfigures the gain structure of each channel, 
making twelve modes in total.<br><br>
The JVM410H front panel looks mind boggling with its twenty-eight controls and eight switches, 
but because it is intuitively laid out, it is remarkably simple to use. The JVM410H also features four studio-quality digital 
Reverbs (one per channel), individual channel EQ, two Master Volumes, and a memory that can recall your Reverb, FX loop and Master
 settings.<br><br>
 Our revolutionary Stompware foot switching technology gives you unprecedented control of your setup, with straight switching
 or programmable switching. The six-button footswitch (supplied) connects to the amp using a standard guitar lead, so you re n
 ot restricted by stage size – and if your cable fails, then its very easy to replace. Stompware technology was described 
 by Guitar Player Magazine as: ‘Clever, very clever.’
 <br><br>
		
		Combining some of the finest Marshall® sounds, the JVM410H has a vast tonal palette, taking you from ‘Plexi’/JTM45  cleans through JCM800  roar to modern high gain.
