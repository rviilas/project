The baddest of the bad! This is our no holds barred, hard rock tone machine. When we set out to design the Lynx we wanted to build the best high gain amplifier on the market. We brought everything to the table and all the tricks we've learned over the years.
<br><br>
Huge and full, but with a note articulation not found at these levels of gain. Saturation and tone is so full that the single notes are fat. Chords are deep and full because we run the power section in Class A to get your harmonics souring in and out of the chords, and single notes at will. There is a complexity and three-dimensional quality to the sound of this amp that separates it from any other high gain amp. The clean channel on the Lynx is much more than an afterthought. Running in Class A brings out all of the shimmer in the highs and ghost harmonics in a clean chording passage. We brought the Bad Cat sound to the Lynx high gain.
