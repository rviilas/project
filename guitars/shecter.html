		<p class="role"> Shecter - Nick Johnston Traditional - S/S/S</p>
		Nick Johnston is friends with the Shecter signature artist Keith Marrow who introduced Nick to the company.
		Shecter was so impressed with Nick that they sent him some of their guitars to play which eventually led to a signature model.
		Nick has always been a lover of Stratocasters so his signature guitar was naturally a Strat style guitar with all three pickups
		being single coils.
