		<p class="bio">
		Mikael Akerfeldt and his band Opeth are all PRS artists and use their guitars. The PRS Custom 24 is the most iconic model
		in the PRS line. A modified Les Paul shape with beautiful carved flamed maple tops. PRS is well known for having some of the prettiest
		guitars in the business.<br><br>
		The Custom24 is a 24 fret guitar that has a warm sounding mahogany body. The neck is also mahogany with a rosewood fingerboard featuring classic
		PRS bird inlays for the fret markers.
		<br><br>
		The bridge is nickel PRS Tremolo and the headstock has PRS Phase III Locking Tuners. The Custom24 is a dual humbucker guitar featuring the PRS 85/15 but the tone
		knob can be used to split the coils. There is also one volume knob and a 5-way blade switch.
