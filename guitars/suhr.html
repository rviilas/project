		<p class="role"> Suhr Classic Pro - S/S/H</p>
		Ian Thornley is a Suhr signature artist and he almost exclusively uses Suhr gear for his sound including many of their guitars.
		Although Ian uses Suhr Modern type guitars aswell featuring either a H/H or a H/S/H configuration he has said that
		his most favorite is a strat style S/S/S or S/S/H guitar such as the Suhr Classic Pro he has been seen using.<br>
		The Suhr Classic Pro is a classical Stratocaster type guitar with an alder body and a maple neck. It is a 22 fret guitar
		with a rosewood fingerboard and medium stainless steel frets. The bridge is a Gotoh510 tremolo.<br>
		The middle and neck pickups are Suhr patented humless V70 single coils and a V70 humbucker in the bridge.
		The control is a classic 5-way blade switch with a volume and 2 tone knobs.
