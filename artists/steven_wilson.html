		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p class="bio">
		Steven John Wilson (born 3 November 1967) is an English musician and record producer, most associated with the progressive rock genre. Currently a solo artist, he became known as the founder,
		lead guitarist, singer and songwriter of the band Porcupine Tree, as well as being a member of several other bands. 
		He has also worked with artists such as Opeth, King Crimson, Pendulum, Jethro Tull, XTC, Yes, Marillion, Orphaned Land and Anathema.
		<br><br>Wilson is a self-taught producer, audio engineer, guitar and keyboard player, playing other instruments as needed, including bass guitar, autoharp, hammered dulcimer and flute. 
		He currently lives in Hemel Hempstead, the town he grew up in, but has also spent time living in London and Tel Aviv, Israel, although he does not hold a residence in Tel Aviv anymore.
		<br><br>His music has received wide acclaim. He has been four times nominated for the Grammy Awards, twice with Porcupine Tree, with his collaborative band Storm Corrosion and as a soloist on one occasion.
		In 2015, he received three awards at the London Progressive Music Awards for his services to the world of progressive rock music and crowned "the king of prog rock".

		<p class="comment">
		Why he made the list:
		<br><br>
		I started listening to Porcupine Tree, which Steven Wilson is most known for, about 7 years ago.
		Their music instantly clicked with me as I just loved their sound. The guitar playing was great
		with tasteful solos and excellent rythm playing but it was mostly about how it all came together.
		Steven writes beautiful arrangements and is a master when it comes to composition and their
		phenomenal drummer and bassist give an excellent rythm and backbone to the songs.
		<br><br>I was sad when Porcupine Tree was put on hiatus but luckily
		Steven's solo albums have been just as good if not better because his music keeps evolving and going
		into different genres. Steven Wilson also writes amazing lyrics that really resonate with me and he continually makes his music
		interesting and satifying to listen to. Steven Wilson is one of my absolute favorite artists and has been for the past 7 years.
